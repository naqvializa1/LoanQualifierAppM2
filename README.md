# Automated Loan Qualifier

Applying for a loan can be an arduous and time consuming process. This automated loan qualifier allows users to upload a csv file of their choosing, containing a list of lenders, maximum loan amount, max loan to value ration (LTV), max debt to income ratio (DTI), min credit score and interest rate, input their personal financial details and run them through a calculator. The user then has the ability to save the list of qualified loans in the form of a csv directly to their machine.
